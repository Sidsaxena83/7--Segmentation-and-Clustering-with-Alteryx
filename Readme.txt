I recently got scholarship from Udacity to undertake a Business Analyst Nano-Degree (BAND) program post successfully completing Udacity’s Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge. The BAND program involved multiple projects in areas like Data Visualisation using Tableau and A/B testing, Classification Models, Time Series Forecasting, Segmentation and Clustering using Alteryx. I have recently completed the same. 

* Project 1. Problem Solving with Analytics using Alteryx- Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.
a) Project: Predicting Diamond Price
b) Project: Predicting Catalog Demand

* Project 2: Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx-  Select the Location for a Pet Store and Create Reports from a Database using SQL

* Project 3: Data Visualization in Tableau- Visualizing Movie Data

* Project 4: Classification Models through Alterx- Predicting Default Risk- Use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

* Project 5: A/B Testing- A/B Test a New Menu Launch- Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

* Project 6: Time Series Forecasting to Forecast Video Game Sales: Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behaviour of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

* Project: 7: Segmentation and Clustering: Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modelling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model. Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
